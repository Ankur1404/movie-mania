# Movie Mania 🎬

> A learning project to explore building a movie discovery web app using various web technologies.

## Project Overview 🧐

Movie Mania is a web application built as part of my learning process. The goal of this project is to practice and explore key web development concepts, including:

- **Frontend Development**: Using React to build interactive UIs.
- **Backend Development**: Building a basic API with Node.js and Express.
- **Third-party API Integration**: Fetching movie data from an external API (such as The Movie Database API).
- **User Authentication (Optional)**: Implementing user login/logout functionality (if planned).

## Tech Stack 🛠

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **API**: External movie data API (like TMDB)
- **Database**: MongoDB (or others if applicable)

## Features Implemented ✨

This project is still in the learning phase, but here are some concepts I have worked on:

- **Fetch movie data**: Display movies with basic details fetched from an API.
- **Basic UI**: A simple front-end design to showcase movie data.
- **Responsive layout**: Ensure the application is mobile-friendly.
